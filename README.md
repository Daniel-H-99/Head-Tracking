# Landmark Detection and Tracking

We use two open source library in our project. You need to download and install them before running our scripts. One is Dlib (See [http://dlib.net](http://dlib.net) for downloading and installation). Another one is eos, which is a lightweight 3D Morphable Face Model fitting library.(The link is https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/releases.)

## Sample code

Run the code “landmark_detection_img.py”. It will show the landmark detection of a sample image.
As for video processing, “landmark_detection_video.py” shows the landmark tracking in a sample video.
